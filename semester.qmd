## Week 1

### Market Research

First Data Analysis

#### Analyze Netflix Data with Excel

*[Here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-pivottable-to-analyze-worksheet-data-a9a84538-bfe9-40a9-a8e9-f99134456576) you can find instructions on how to create Pivot Tables.*

Descriptive analysis of Netflix data:

1. Download the [üìä Netflix data (Google Sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QO0UfC43YwJ0YIg5LWaYkVUX-qGh93wZZ6JLyHa3_bg/edit?gid=1337641040#gid=1337641040) in Excel format from the Google Sheets file.  
2. Create your own Pivot Table (with "group" as rows and "outcome" as columns) and display percentage values.
3. Open Excel, go to the "Home" menu, and click on "Analyze Data."  


#### Analyze Netflix Data with Generative AI

## Week 9


Task: Regression Analysis Exercise: Social Media Campaign Success:


**Data**: [Download the data to Excel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r76Qa87HicgHV2ZVFaVBGQnn5WwZPIVRyqYxu2yS7_s/edit?usp=sharing)

**Objective:** Analyze factors influencing the success of a social media campaign using regression in Excel.

**Dataset Variables:**

* **`Row`**: Observation number.
* **`Conversions`** (Dependent Variable): Number of desired actions (e.g., sales, sign-ups) generated by the campaign.
* **`AdSpendEuro`** (Independent Variable): Amount spent on paid social media advertising for the campaign (in Euros).
* **`InfluencerMentions`** (Independent Variable): Number of mentions or dedicated posts by relevant influencers during the campaign.
* **`ContentQualityScore`** (Independent Variable): A rating (scale 1-10) of the perceived quality and appeal of the social media content.
* **`PostReachOrganic`** (Independent Variable): The number of unique users who saw the campaign's organic (non-paid) posts.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Explore Data:**
    * Calculate descriptive statistics for Conversions (mean and standard deviation).
    * Create plots of `Conversions` vs. each independent variable. State your initial insights about relationships.
2.  **Perform Regression (Excel Data Analysis):**
    * Predict different models using `Conversions` as an outcome variable. Obtain $R^2$. 
3.  **Interpret Results:**
    * Explain $R^2$ for each model
4.  **Discussion:**
    * Which variables significantly impact conversions?
    * What are the practical implications for managing a social media campaign based on your findings?


## Week 10

Task: Multiple Regression Analysis 

Finding Regression Options in Excel

On Mac:

- **Tools** ‚Üí **Add-Ins** ‚Üí **Data Analysis** ‚Üí **Regression**

On Windows:
